## Adding a New Language

Want to add support for another language? It's easy!

### Step 1: Create Translation File

Create a new JSON file in the `translations` folder with your language code:

```bash
translations/[language-code].json
```

For example, for Norwegian: `translations/no.json`

### Step 2: Copy and Translate

Copy the contents of `en.json` and translate all the values (keep the keys in English):

```json
{
  "LOADING": "Your translation here...",
  "ERROR": "Your translation here...",
  "NO_FIXTURES": "Your translation here...",
  ...
}
```

### Step 3: Register the Language

Edit `MMM-MyTeams-DriveToMatch.js` and add your language to the `getTranslations()` function:

```javascript
getTranslations: function() {
    return {
        en: "translations/en.json",
        es: "translations/es.json",
        fr: "translations/fr.json",
        de: "translations/de.json",
        it: "translations/it.json",
        nl: "translations/nl.json",
        pt: "translations/pt.json",
        gd: "translations/gd.json",
        ga: "translations/ga.json",
        no: "translations/no.json"  // Add your new language here
    };
},
```

### Step 4: Test

Set your MagicMirror language to the new code and restart to test!

## Notes

### Date and Time Formatting

Date and time formats are handled separately by the browser's `toLocaleDateString()` function and will automatically adapt to your locale setting in `config.js`.

### Currency Symbols

The fuel cost currency symbol (£, €, $, etc.) is automatically localized based on your selected language:

- **English (en):** £ (British Pound)
- **Spanish (es):** € (Euro)
- **French (fr):** € (Euro)
- **German (de):** € (Euro)
- **Italian (it):** € (Euro)
- **Dutch (nl):** € (Euro)
- **Portuguese (pt):** € (Euro)
- **Scottish Gaelic (gd):** £ (British Pound)
- **Irish Gaelic (ga):** € (Euro)

To customize the currency symbol for a language, edit the `CURRENCY_SYMBOL` key in the corresponding translation file (e.g., `translations/en.json`).

### Team Names and Venue Names

Team names, venue names, and competition names are **not translated** as they are proper nouns that come directly from TheSportsDB API.

### Fallback Behavior

If a translation key is missing from a language file, the module will fall back to the English translation automatically.

## Contributing Translations

If you'd like to contribute a translation for a new language or improve an existing one:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create/edit the translation file
3. Test thoroughly
4. Submit a pull request

**Translation Guidelines:**
- Keep translations concise (space is limited on the display)
- Maintain the same tone and formality as the English version
- Test with actual fixture data to ensure text fits properly
- Consider football/soccer terminology specific to your region

## Troubleshooting

### Module shows English despite language setting

**Solution:** Check that:
1. Your language code in `config.js` matches exactly (case-sensitive)
2. The translation file exists in the `translations` folder
3. The language is registered in `getTranslations()` function
4. You've restarted MagicMirror after making changes

### Some text is not translated

**Solution:** 
1. Check if the text is a proper noun (team/venue name) - these are not translated
2. Verify the translation key exists in your language file
3. Check browser console for any JavaScript errors

### Translation file not loading

**Solution:**
1. Verify JSON syntax is valid (use a JSON validator)
2. Check file encoding is UTF-8
3. Ensure file permissions allow reading
4. Check MagicMirror logs for file loading errors

## Language-Specific Notes

### Scottish Gaelic (gd)
Scottish Gaelic support is included as a tribute to Celtic FC fans! The translations use standard Scottish Gaelic orthography. Note that Gaelic has different word order and grammar structures, so some translations are adapted rather than literal.

### Irish Gaelic (ga)
Irish Gaelic (Gaeilge) support is included for Irish football fans! The translations use standard Irish orthography following the Caighdeán Oifigiúil (Official Standard). Irish has different grammatical structures from English, including initial mutations and the VSO (Verb-Subject-Object) word order, so some translations are adapted for clarity.

### Portuguese (pt)
The Portuguese translation uses European Portuguese conventions. Brazilian Portuguese speakers may prefer slightly different terminology for some football terms.

### Spanish (es)
The Spanish translation uses neutral Spanish that should be understood across all Spanish-speaking regions, though some football terminology may vary by country.

## Future Enhancements

Potential future additions:
- More languages (Norwegian, Swedish, Danish, Polish, etc.)
- Regional variants (en-US vs en-GB, pt-BR vs pt-PT)
- User-customizable translations via config
- Dynamic currency symbol based on locale
- RTL (right-to-left) language support (Arabic, Hebrew)
